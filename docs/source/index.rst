In this article, we’ll explain why your **Canon printer shows offline** and provide easy, step-by-step solutions to bring it back online.

Common Causes of Canon Printer Offline Status
---------------------------------------------

Before jumping into the solutions, let’s look at the possible reasons your Canon printer might show an offline status:

1. **Network Connection Issues**  
   If the printer is connected via Wi-Fi or network, any drop in connection can cause it to appear offline on your device.

2. **Outdated or Missing Printer Drivers**  
   Using outdated or incompatible printer drivers often leads to offline errors.

3. **Printer Set to Offline Mode**  
   Sometimes, your printer might be manually set to offline mode in system settings.

4. **Default Printer Not Selected**  
   If another printer is set as default, your system might not detect the Canon printer when needed.

5. **Paper Jams or Hardware Errors**  
   Physical issues like paper jams or open printer covers can also prevent normal operations.

6. **Spooler Service Errors (Windows)**  
   Issues with the print spooler service may stop communication between the system and printer.
